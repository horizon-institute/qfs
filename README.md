This is the static site for the Grow Your Own Adventure app (i.e, the story "Quest for the Silver Goblet" is baked in).  It was written using next.js [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  Note that the non-static version (see the gyoa repo) requires that you have a Google Firestore account, and it uses the Storage and Firebase services, to store Base64 encoded audio files and json story scripts respectively.  The gyoa app was written to run on [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme); its free tier is more than sufficient.

## Getting Started locally

First install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Serving off github pages

Turning a next.js application into a static site is a little fiddly.  The next export file creates an 'out' directory.  The .github/workflows/deploy.yml defines a series of actions that then need to be taken to make it serve properly as a pages site.  Once you have pushed this version, check to see that the action has fired.  To see it withing gthub, go to the settings->pages and click on deploy from branch gh-pages, which should have been generated by the github workflow actions.  You will need to wait a minute or two then you should see the site at:
